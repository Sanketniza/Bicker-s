## Benefits of Using Transactional Email Services

1. **Better Deliverability**: These services maintain good sender reputations
2. **Detailed Analytics**: Track open rates, click rates, bounces, etc.
3. **Higher Sending Limits**: More suitable for production applications
4. **Simplified Setup**: No need to deal with 2FA and app passwords
5. **Reliability**: Built for high-volume, mission-critical emails

## Implementation Steps

1. Sign up for one of the services above
2. Update your `.env` file with the new credentials
3. No code changes needed - your current implementation will work with these services
4. Restart your server and test

For production applications, a dedicated email service is strongly recommended over Gmail SMTP.
